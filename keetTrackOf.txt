1) Still unsure what to use in chatName (req.user.name or any other)

const chatData = {
		chatName: req.user.name,
		isGroupChat: false,
		users: [req.user._id, userId],
	};

2) in the createGroup function in chatControllers.js , while writing frontend for it, make the create button unclickable if selected users count is < 2 (excluding the user who is creating the group)
